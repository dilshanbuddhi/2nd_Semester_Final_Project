Tourism Platform........

This tourism project aims to provide a platform for foreigners to explore attractive places in a country, view weather updates, find hotels, and book transport for their trips. Users can search for places based on categories like beaches, mountains, historical sites, etc., and they can also book hotels in the selected places. The system will allow users to view available rooms, make bookings, and leave reviews for places and hotels. It integrates key features like place search, hotel booking, transport management, tour packages, and weather information.

 Tour Guides

    - Guide profiles will include information such as:
        - Experience: Years of guiding experience, specialized types of tours (historical, adventure, cultural, etc.).
        - Languages Spoken: Guides will list the languages they can speak fluently.
        - Certifications: Guides can upload certificates or licenses that verify their credentials.
        - Reviews and Ratings: Previous tourists can leave feedback, helping new users select the best guide.
